# NSGAII3DHPSC
Repository containing the code used and develloped for the 3DHPSC protein model for biobjective  landscape, using the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II(NSGA -II) method. 

this project is in constant development for improvements in execution and results.

This project was used as a theme for my master's degree.
For explanations about the algorithm and movement of the protein in the truss please read chapter 3 of the dissertation.
